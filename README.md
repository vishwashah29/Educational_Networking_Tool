# Educational_Networking_Tool

The objective of our project is to provide a platform for students across the globe to interact with others with similar interests. The students from different colleges can take part in discussion and problem solving. It will be a tool where students can network among themselves and with professors from different universities. We wish to provide a one-go platform for academicians to learn and grow. The students can post their doubts on discussion forums and get them solved by the community. The professors can find passionate collaborates easily by posting their project openings on the project forum. This forum is great for students who are interested in exploring research options.
